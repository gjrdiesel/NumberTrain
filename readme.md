# NumberTrain

Inspired by a friend, this will be an application that keeps track of all your social media numbers and graph them over
the last 7 days. Right out the gate, gonna go for twitter numbers, maybe youtube if there is time.

Just going to be a simple as can be dashboard, user registration. Let's jump in.

Ultimately, IG likes, twitch, etc would be nice too.

Let's start with models I guess, been a long time since I started a new project.
